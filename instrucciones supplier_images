In a similar way, you are going to write a script named supplier_image_upload.py that takes the jpeg images from the supplier-data/images directory that you've processed previously and uploads them to the web server fruit catalog.

Use the nano editor to create a file named supplier_image_upload.py:

nano ~/supplier_image_upload.py
Copied!
Complete the script with the same technique as used in the file example_upload.py.

Once you have completed editing the supplier_image_upload.py script, save the file by typing Ctrl-o, Enter key, and Ctrl-x.

Grant executable permission to the supplier_image_upload.py script.

sudo chmod +x ~/supplier_image_upload.py
Copied!
Run the supplier_image_upload.py script.

./supplier_image_upload.py
Copied!
Refresh the URL opened earlier, and now you should find all the images uploaded successfully.
